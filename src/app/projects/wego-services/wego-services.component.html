        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            With the increasing prevalence of autonomous vehicles in everyday life, we seek to utilise them as
            more
            than just rideshares or food and grocery deliveries. Need your suit pressed for a party this
            eveneing?
            Weâ€™ve got you covered. Need medication delivered on short notice? We can do that too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal of this project was to produce a proof of concept for a Transportation as a Service web
            application that would provide every day services, such as RX delivery, dry-cleaning, etc., as a
            part of
            an ever growing suite of services that under the WeGo brand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our autonomours vehicle vendors will be the main providers of couriers for each of the services that
            we
            indend to provide. WIth our software, our vendors would be able to maintain, monitor and simulate
            the
            vehicles they have provided us.

            Unfortunately, due to our servers being owned by our school, they have since been destroyed and
            deactivated. I would like to the full service on my own sever but for now, here are the static HTML
            pages. Again, this will mean that many of the dynamic elements, the exciting things about our web-app, such
            as account states, live map generation and the acutual placing an order will not be functional. But if you
            would like to see all of the logic, the JavaScript and Python scripts are available in the code repository
            below. Otherwise the page specific scripts are at the bottom of each card
        </p>
        <h4>Site-Wide Scripts:</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td style="padding-right: 20px;" *ngFor="let script of siteWideScripts">
                    <a class="script-link"
                        attr.href="https://github.com/sp20-swei-Team22/{{ script.cloud }}/blob/master/js/{{ script.name }}"
                        target="_blank"><span>{{ script.name }}</span></a>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            Primarily just scripts that help site wide navigation and high level session management.
