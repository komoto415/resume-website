                        I was born in Texas and raised in Hong Kong where I had all of my schooling, all the way
                        from Reception to the 12th grade. I am now back stateside in Austin, Texas for college.

                        Despite the various career paths I have attempted, Journalism, Global Studies, I always find myself back on track in some sort of engineering field. A part of me has always known I wanted a designer and builder and it wasn't fully realised until university.
