<h4>Learning how to Conform with Design</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        Up until now, projects were fairly straight forward. As far as design constraints were concerned, all there was
        to
        it was a simple interface. However, problems werenâ€™t complex enough to have lots of different forms of
        implementation nor were we seeking any kind of optimisations. Although some testing practices existed prior to
        this
        class, Components would be the first class to try and promote the usage of unit tests and for students to begin
        writing their own test cases for assignments.

        <h5>Dominoes</h5>
        <p>
            The stand out assignments from this class was Dominoes part 1 and 2. The main arc of them could be
            simplified into one question: How do we comply with a client's representation of
            a concept that we developed, and use it with our representation of the same concept? In other words, how do we as the developers of the program/interface contend with this mismatch of concept representation? In essence that's what Dominoes was; lots different ways of representing the same concept interfacing and translating between different client facing representations of the domino concept.

        <h5>Ambiguous Ambiguity </h5>
        <p>
            Though that does seem to be the assignment that many alumni of the class remember, the heart of this class,
            I
            believe, was in all of its weirdness and how it leans on ambiguity. Assignment handouts were often times
            left
            short
            on information, documented poorly or in an unhelpful way and once asked for the incorrect formatting on
            deliverables. Intentionally. This was especially terrifying because you had one submission and no ones tests
            to
            run
            against except if you had made your own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some students found it frustrating which I can understand, but like no other class before it, Components was
            designed to
            reward those who took the time to read the assignment sheets early and to spending time looking for
            potential
            errors, inconsistencies and/or short comings. If you didn't, the difference between getting a 50 and a 100
            might
            as
            well have been a coin flip. Like no other class before it makes you appreciate good documentation and
            well-formed
            specifications in documentation. But, though perhaps more due to the nature of the assignment concepts, it
            really
            forced you to come up with <strong>good</strong> clarifying questions and better ways to clearly articulate
            your
            point.

            With the combination of assignments and professor, Components is easily one of my favourite
            classes in university and comes to be one of the closest we get to learning about <strong>design</strong>
            principles
            and
            the <strong>limitations</strong> of that design outside of our
            Software Engineering class.
