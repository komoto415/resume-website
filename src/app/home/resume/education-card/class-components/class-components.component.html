<h4>Learning How to Conform with Design</h4>

    <p>
        Up until now, projects were fairly straight forwards. As far as design constraints were concerned, all there was
        to
        it was a simple interface. However, problems werenâ€™t complex enough to have lots of different forms of
        implementation nor were we seeking any kind of optimisations. Although some testing practices existed prior to
        this
        class, Components would be the first class to try and promote the usage of unit tests and that student beging to
        write their own test cases for their assignments.

        <h5>Dominos</h5>
        <p>
            The stand out assignments from this class have got to be Dominos part 1 and 2. The main arc of them could be
            simplified into one question: How do we comply with a client's representation of
            a concept that we developed, and use it with our representatation of the same concept? For example, at an
            instance level, our domino might be represented as two integer variables, aptly named lowPipCount and
            highPipCount. But say the method in which our client interfaces with our instance is a string where the
            first number is the high, the second the low and delimited by a colon. This translation can also be
            represented in a table as so:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row justify-content-around" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        <div class="col nomargin d-flex justify-content-center">
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <th>Client</th>
                    <th>Internal</th>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>highLowString = "0:0"</td>
                        <td>lowPipCount = 0, highPipCount = 0</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>highLowString = "1:0"</td>
                        <td>lowPipCount = 0, highPipCount = 1</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>highLowString = "2:0"</td>
                        <td>lowPipCount = 0, highPipCount = 2</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        <div class="col nomargin d-flex justify-content-center">
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <th>Client</th>
                    <th>Internal</th>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>highLowString = "3:0"</td>
                        <td>lowPipCount = 0, highPipCount = 3</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>highLowString = "4:0"</td>
                        <td>lowPipCount = 0, highPipCount = 4</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>highLowString = "5:0"</td>
                        <td>lowPipCount = 0, highPipCount = 5</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        so on and so forth. With this in mind, how do we as the developrs of the program/interface contend with this
        mismatch is concept representation? In essence that's what Dominos was; lots different ways of representing the
        same
        concept interfacing and translating between different client facing representations of the dominos concept.

    <h5>Ambiguous Ambiguity </h5>
    <p>
        Though that does seem to be the assignment that many alumni of the class remember, the heart of this class, I
        believe, was in all of its weirdness and how it leans on ambiguity. Assignment handouts were often times left
        short
        on information, documented unclearly or in an unhelpful way and once asked for the incorrect formatting on
        deliverables. Intentionally. This was especially terrifying because you had one submission and no ones tests to
        run
        against except if you had made your own.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some students found it frustrating which I can understand, but like no other class before it, it was designed to
        reward those who took the time to read the assignment sheets early and to spending time looking for potential
        errors, inconsistencies and/or short comings. If you didn't, the difference between getting a 50 and a 100 might
        as
        well have been a coin flip. Like no other class before it makes you appreciate good documentation and
        well-formed
        specifications in documentation. But, though perhaps more due to the nature of the assignment concepts, it
        really
        forced you to come up with <strong>good</strong> clarifying questions and to find ways to clearly articulate
        your
        point.

        The assignments we had in combination with the professor, Components is easily one of my favourite
        classes in university and comes to be one closets we get to learning about <strong>design</strong> principles
        and
        the <strong>limitations</strong> of that design outside our <span id="goToSWE" data-toggle="modal"
